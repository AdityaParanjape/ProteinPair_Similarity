# RCSB Protein Data Analysis - First Run

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for the analysis and visualization of protein data sourced from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). The notebook guides users through fetching, processing, and exploring protein-related data with Python.

## Features
- **Data fetching**: Retrieves protein data from the RCSB database.
- **Data preprocessing**: Cleans and organizes the data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful plots to explore protein characteristics.
- **Analysis workflow**: Integrates computational tools to uncover patterns in protein data.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `os`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `requests`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Open the notebook `ProteinPair_Similarity.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the workflow.

## Notebook Structure

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the protein data analysis pipeline.
2. **Setup**: Imports necessary libraries and sets up the environment.
3. **Data Fetching**: Fetches protein data from the RCSB PDB using APIs.
4. **Preprocessing**: Cleans and formats the raw data for analysis.
5. **Visualization**: Creates plots to visualize various protein properties.
6. **Analysis**: Explores trends and patterns in the protein dataset.

## Output
The notebook generates:
- Tabular data summaries
- Visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts)
- Analytical insights on protein characteristics
